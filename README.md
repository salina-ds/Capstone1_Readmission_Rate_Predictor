# Capstone1_Readmission_Rate_Predictor
This is the first Capstone Project for the Data Science Career Track Program at Springboard. The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a patient is going to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge. This information aims to help hospitals make better decisions in managing resources as well as patient outcome.
